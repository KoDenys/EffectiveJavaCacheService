# EffectiveJavaCacheService
Let's take as the base of our homework "Effective Java" book by Joshua Bloch.

Implement cache service. Cache entries (objects) â€“ simple custom class with one String field. Your cache service should have 2 methods: get and put.

Your cache service should fit next requirements:

    Max Size = 100 000;
    Eviction policy;
    Time-based on last access (5 seconds);
    Removal listener; 
    Just add to log of removed entry; 
    Give statistic to user; 
    Average time spent for putting new values into the cache; 
    Number of cache evictions; 
    Support concurrency.

This task should be implemented in two ways:

    Simple Java (2 points) (Strategy: LFU); 
    Guava (1 point) (Strategy: LRU).

Don't forget about good tests, checkstyle and other staff that already included into your build phase.
